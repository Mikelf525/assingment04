# This visualization shows the growth value of three industries in provinces with different numbers of top universities.

# We can draw two interesting conclusions:

# 1. With the increase in the number of top universities, the value added of the tertiary industry has the largest change, and the smallest is the primary industry.

# 2. From the point of view of marginal effects, having a moderate number of top universities (about two) produces the highest value-added of the three major industries. This shows that the Chinese government is considering ensuring that each province has one or two top universities, which will generate the greatest benefits.
