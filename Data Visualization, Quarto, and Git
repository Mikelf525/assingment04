#The growth rates of three industries in provinces with varying numbers of top universities are represented in this image. We can deduce two interesting findings:

#1.The value added of the tertiary industry has changed the most as the number of top universities has increased, while the primary industry has changed the least.

#2. From the perspective of marginal effects, the three main industries have the maximum value-added when there are only a small number of top universities (about two). This demonstrates that the Chinese government is thinking about ensuring that each province has one or two top universities because doing so will have the biggest positive effects.

#This graphic tries to show the fiscal education spending amounts and trends in Chinese provinces with various numbers of prestigious institutions. Fiscal spending on education in provinces with two top-tier universities is growing at a far faster rate than in other provincial types, according to expenditure statistics. Besides, the fiscal spending from the federal government is positively associated with the number of top universities at the early stage . The expenditures of provinces with two or three prestigious institutions started to catch up in the later period, especially after 2007.

#China is divided into six parts in this image, and there are five levels of education. By examining the ratio of schools at various levels, we may assess the progress of Chinese education in various locations. According to the findings, education progress in different parts of China is uneven. For instance, the north has developed higher education much more than other regions, and other regions have developed basic education clearly more than the north has.

#With the help of this graphic, you can see how the population and top universities are distributed unequally among China's various provinces and regions. Some populous provinces, like Henan, lack prestigious universities. However, while having only a small portion of China's population, Beijing, Shanghai, and other cities have a significant number of top university education resources.
